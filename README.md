# cardinality_experiments

This code was written to investigate and better understand the performance of high-cardinality terms aggregations and the impact of [global ordinals](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.3/eager-global-ordinals.html) in Elasticsearch. The results are described at: https://www.elastic.co/blog/improving-the-performance-of-high-cardinality-terms-aggregations-in-elasticsearch
